Random Forest Experiment for Power Transformer Gas Analysis

This study presents a Random Forest-based approach for analyzing dissolved gases in power transformers. Transformers contain insulating oil that decomposes under electrical and thermal stress, generating characteristic gases. Monitoring these gases enables predictive maintenance, allowing early fault detection and performance optimization before critical failures occur.

The analysis incorporates both dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data and operational electrical parameters. By integrating chemical and electrical datasets, the model predicts remaining service life and assesses failure risk, thereby enhancing maintenance strategies and operational reliability.

This work was developed for the Pattern Recognition course in the Master of Computer Science program at Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL).
