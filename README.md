Random Forest Experiment for Power Transformer Gas Analysis

This is a Random Forest experiment designed to analyze the gases in power transformers. Power transformers contain oil, which produces various types of gases. 
These gases can be used for predictive maintenance, helping to detect potential faults and optimize transformer performance before failures occur. 
In addition to oil gases, electrical parameters (measured during operation) are also included in the analysis. By combining electrical and chemical data, 
this approach can predict remaining lifespan and damage risk, improving reliability and maintenance planning.
